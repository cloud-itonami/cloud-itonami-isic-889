  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-889 non-residential social-work
  operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only            -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging     -- contact-note logging allowed, every
                                     write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination-- adds appointment scheduling, referral
                                     coordination, benefits-application
                                     assistance, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto      -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                     `:log-client-contact-note`/`:schedule-appointment`/
                                     `:coordinate-referral`/`:coordinate-benefits-application-assistance`
                                     may auto-commit. `:flag-safety-concern`
                                     NEVER auto-commits, at any phase.

  `:flag-safety-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Flagging a safety concern always
  needs a human to actually look at it. `socialworkops.governor`'s own
  `always-escalate-ops` enforces the same invariant independently --
  two layers, not one, agree on this."
